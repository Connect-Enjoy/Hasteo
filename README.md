# Hasteo – College Bus Attendance & Management System 🚌✨
Hasteo is a smart, web-based Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to digitize and automate college bus attendance tracking and transportation management. It replaces manual paper-based systems with barcode scanning, real-time tracking, and ML-powered anomaly detection for efficient campus transportation operations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Hasteo transforms traditional bus attendance systems by:
- Automating student verification using barcode scanning of student IDs
- Tracking bus arrivals/departures with digital timestamps
- Distinguishing between day scholars and hostellers with category-based tracking
- Providing real-time dashboards for security and administrative oversight
- Detecting irregular attendance patterns using machine learning algorithms

**Built With:**
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, QuaggaJS (Barcode Scanning)
- Backend: Python Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL (Neon.tech cloud database)
- UI: Modern glassmorphism design with responsive PWA capabilities
- ML Integration: scikit-learn (Isolation Forest for anomaly detection)
